# RevoU Software Enginering Fundamental Course
This is my project from joining a Bootcamp created by RevoU for 10 days, and this is my first step to learning Software Engineering to create a website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 Sorry if it has a bad or messy design because I just started to learn those days.
